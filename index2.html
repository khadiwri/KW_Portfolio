            <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
            <div class="text-centered section-set">
              <p>First I will begin with my name, Khadine(kay-dean) Wright. I was born on September 1, 1998. My passion for web development began in high school when I attended a STEM program hosted by Morehouse College during the summer of 2015. Because of this program, I decided that I would major in computer engineering to become a versed software engineer. 
              </p>
              <p>My first experience with web development took place while I was enrolled at M.E. Stilwell School of Arts. I was registered to a graphic design course and was assigned to make a website using html and css. It was a basic one-page html file that showcased images I photographed throughout the semester. Other assignments gave me experience in Adobe illustrator and photoshop. 
              </p>
              <p>As a student at Thinkful, I hope to learn a lot about web/app development and become a fully equipped software developer to work in the industry.
